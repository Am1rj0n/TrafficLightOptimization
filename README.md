# TrafficLightOptimization
Optimization for traffic lights code used for research project finding the most optimal time for traffic lights near hospitals during rush hour to reduce congestion. 


The code for optimization is used for optimizing the traffic light from volume of cars per hour on both sides of the intersection. The code will simulate and find the best optimal time, under a cycle of 90 seconds. Which can be changed. To use it, simply change the name of the streets. Change the cycle count. Then run the code to input the volume of cars from both sides. 

THe code for the control group is to compare before and after results. Input the volume of cars and the cycle length after running the code to begin the simulation and get info such as average wait, combined wait, and wait for each intersection. 


ALSO CHANGE THE FLOW RATE OF CARS. IT WILL GREATLY AFFECT YOUR RESULTS
